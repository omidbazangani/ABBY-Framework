"""
Abby comes with a device-agnostic firmware that can run multiple block ciphers
and can be flashed on a large variety of boards.
This firmware is meant to be used to generate training or evaluation data for
side-channel models.

Building and flashing process
-----------------------------

To simplify build and flashing process, Abby uses
`PlatformIO <https://platformio.org/>`_.
This tool provides a common abstraction over multiples boards.
Depending on targeted board, it will automatically download matching
cross-compilation toolchain and flashing utilities.

Each board is in a separate PlatformIO environment such as ``disco_f051r8``.
The algorithm is given to PlatformIO via ``PLATFORMIO_ALGORITHM`` environment
variable.

To manually use PlatformIO without Abby scripts, you can go to ``abby/firmware``
then launch ``PLATFORMIO_ALGORITHM=tinyaes pio run -t upload -e disco_f051r8``
to flash TinyAES on a ST STM32F051 Discovery.

Target support
--------------

For now this firmware supports only Arduino and LibOpenCM3 frameworks to target
a large variety of boards.

These boards are supported and tested:

* ST Discovery STM32F051 and STM32F030 (``disco_f051r8``)

These boards are implemented but not tested yet:

* Waveshare Core407I or Riscure PiÃ±ata, STM32F407IGT6 (``genericSTM32F407IGT6``)
* BBC Micro:bit v1, Nordic nRF51822 (``bbcmicrobit``)

Code padding
------------

After sending some input data, the firmware runs :

* 500 ``NOP`` instructions,
* the selected algorithm,
* 500 ``NOP`` instructions again.

On ARM Cortex-M0, ``NOP`` is equivalent to ``MOV r8, r8``.
Using ``NOP``, we are adding a reference to ease debugging and alignment.
We also make sure that the instructions triggering acquisitions do not effect
acquired data as activating a GPIO may have an effect on the beginning of the
trace.

Flashing and execution
----------------------

These functions enables you to choose a block cipher and build and flash it.
