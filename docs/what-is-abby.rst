What is Abby?
=============

**Abby is a free and open-source framework providing tools to build and evaluate
side-channel leakage models.**
In this framework, you will find:

    and flashing process,
*   :ref:`a module to train machine learning models and predict side-channel
    traces <model>`,
*   some extra modules to acquire traces from oscilloscopes and
    process them,
*   documentation on how to build and evaluate new models.
